The projects are given in the descending order of utility to fulfilling the [project goals](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/wiki/Project-Goals). In effect, [AutolabJS team members](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/graphs/contributors) would be more excited to receive proposals for [DevOps Integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/gsoc/devops) than to receive proposals for [Modular Load Balancer]({{ site.baseurl }}/gsoc/lb) and so on. Of course, we welcome quality proposals for any of the projects.

Based on your preferences and skill set, please select a project that has high probability of completion. We take due care in assessing the design and testability of all new code contributions. Please make sure that your design adheres to [architectural principles](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/wiki/Proposed-Architecture) of the project. You can check a few merged pull requests, [PR on logger.js](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/pull/236) and [PR on status.js](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/pull/238) to understand the kind of scrutiny the incoming code receives. Based on our follies and experiences, we believe:
> Current development speed is a function of past development quality.
>	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	- Brian McCallister

We expect all the incoming code contributions to have the following code quality attributes:
* Builds on Travis.
* Pass [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/) checks.
* Near 100% unit, integration and functional test coverage.
* Readable code with documentation at all required points.

Please explain your approach to meeting the requested code quality attributes.

The project [wiki](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/wiki) pages are fairly detailed. The wiki documentation elaborates on all the project ideas suggested for GSoC. Please become familiar with the wiki pages that are relevant to your project idea. Our hope is that the content of wiki pages help you in making a strong proposal.

We have compiled a list of [technical libraries and components](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/wiki/References) we found relevant to the project. You are welcome to utilize the references in any way you see fit.

Please keep the project mentors in the loop about your proposals under development. We can provide feedback to help you align the proposals with the project goals. You can use the [online forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/autolabjs) or [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/AutolabJS/gsoc) to interact with the project mentors.

Now please head back to the [GSoC page]({{ site.baseurl }}/gsoc/) to explore the projects. We look forward to your proposals.
